# Welcome to Autonomous Deep Racer

## What is this project?

We're building an **autonomous racing car** that learns to drive by watching humans play. You drive a car in a simulator, and your driving data trains an AI model to drive on its own. Think of it like teaching a student driver — except the student is a neural network.

## What will you learn?

- **Reinforcement Learning** — How AI agents learn from rewards and trial-and-error
- **Data Collection** — How human demonstrations become training data for models
- **Model Training** — How neural networks improve over time with more data
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer** — How models trained in simulation deploy to physical hardware

## How your time in the simulator helps

Every lap you drive in the simulator is recorded as training data — steering angles, speed, camera frames. This data feeds into the model's training pipeline. The more people drive, the more diverse the dataset becomes, and the better the AI learns to handle different situations.

**You don't need to write any code** — just drive the car and you're directly contributing to the AI's improvement.

## For all experience levels

This class is a mix of backgrounds, and that's by design:

- **No coding experience** — Drive the simulator, review dashboards, give feedback on model behavior. Your laps are just as valuable as anyone else's.
- **Some experience** — Help with data pipelines, reward function design, testing and evaluation.
- **Advanced** — Model architecture, training infrastructure, sim-to-real deployment, obstacle detection.

Everyone contributes. The simulator drivers generate the data. The coders build the pipeline. The model learns from all of it.

## How the model improves over time

The project dashboard tracks model performance metrics over time. As more training data is collected from simulator runs, you'll see:

- **Lap completion rate** go up
- **Average lap time** go down
- **Collision rate** decrease
- **Reward scores** increase

This is the core feedback loop of machine learning: more data → better model → better performance.

## Getting started

1. **Check your tasks** on the Kanban board — see what's assigned to you
2. **Read the project docs** — PRD, API spec, hardware spec, repo structure
3. **Set up the simulator** — follow the setup guide in the docs
4. **Start driving!** — every lap counts
